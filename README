This is an implementation of Mahjong solitaire in Tcl/Tk/Snit, because
I play gnome-mahjongg all the time and I wanted to change it.  This was
a lot easier and faster for me than learning how to use the gnome games 
framework.

Yet to do:

[x] Make undo/redo work correctly.
[x] Make undo/redo work on the game generation thread.
[x] Make count-moves work.
[x] Make a menu accelerator that opens the menu.
[x] Make rows and blocks persistent data.
[x] Make row closures persistent data.
[x] Test generated deal in reverse against play rules.
[x] Loop out the failed deals.
[x] Prune the unused methods.
[x] Implement choose game by name.    
[ ] Get the adaptive framing and sizing to work correctly.
[ ] Scale images for window size.
[ ] Make the svg tile set work without inkscape
[ ] Switch back to using xml layout descriptor
[ ] Implement hints
[ ] Implement right/left cursor cycling through hints?
  This doesn't actually work, though I suppose that
  if you select a tile, hint might cycle through the
  matching tiles.
[ ] Fix the generator so it doesn't fail.
[ ] Implement Help.
[ ] Implement Save/Restore game.
