This is an implementation of Mahjong solitaire in Tcl/Tk/Snit/Img.
Because I play gnome-mahjongg all the time and I wanted to change it.
This was a lot easier and faster for me than learning how to use the 
gnome games framework.

The script should run on Linux, Windows, and MacOS using the ActiveTcl
distribution from activestate.com.

Yet to do:

[x] Make undo/redo work correctly.
[x] Make undo/redo work on the game generation thread.
[x] Make count-moves work.
[x] Make a menu accelerator that opens the menu.
[x] Make rows and blocks persistent data.
[x] Make row closures persistent data.
[x] Test generated deal in reverse against play rules.
[x] Loop out the failed deals.
[x] Prune the unused methods.
[x] Implement choose game by name.    
[ ] Get the adaptive framing and sizing to work correctly.
[ ] Scale images for window size.
[ ] Make the svg tile set work without inkscape
[ ] Fix the tiles that don't work in my svg-to-canvas
  because they depend on interior regions in paths being
  transparent to the background.
[ ] Switch back to using xml layout descriptor
[ ] Implement hints
[ ] Implement right/left cursor cycling through hints?
  This doesn't actually work, though I suppose that
  if you select a tile, hint might cycle through the
  matching tiles.  So you could implement a cursor motion
  key mode which cycled through the selectable tiles, used
  <return> to select and then cycled through the selectable 
  matches, and finally used <return> to select the play, or
  used <backspace> to cancel the first selection.
[ ] Fix the generator so it doesn't fail.
  This does throw an uncaught exception sometimes, not sure how.
[ ] Implement Help.
[ ] Implement Save/Restore game.
