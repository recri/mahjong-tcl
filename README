This is an implementation of Mahjong solitaire in Tcl/Tk/Snit, because
I play gnome-mahjongg all the time and I wanted to change it.  This was
a lot easier and faster for me than learning how to use the gnome games 
framework.

Yet to do:

[ ] Get the adaptive framing and sizing to work correctly.
[ ] Scale images for window size.
[x] Make undo/redo work correctly.
[ ] Make undo/redo work on the game generation thread.
[x] Make count-moves work.
[ ] Make rows and blocks persistent data
[ ] Make row closures persistent data
[ ] Make the svg tile set work without inkscape
[ ] Switch back to using xml layout descriptor
[ ] Prune the unused methods
