This is an implementation of Mahjong solitaire in Tcl/Tk/Snit, because
I play gnome-mahjongg all the time and I wanted to change it.  This was
a lot easier and faster than learning how to use the gnome games 
framework.

Yet to do:

[ ] Get the adaptive framing and sizing to work correctly.
[ ] Scale down images for reduced window sizes.
[ ] Make undo/redo work correctly.
[ ] Make undo/redo work on the game generation thread.
[ ] Make count-moves work.
