This is an implementation of Mahjong solitaire in Tcl/Tk/Snit/Img.
Because I play gnome-mahjongg all the time and I wanted to change it.
This was a lot easier and faster for me than learning how to use the 
gnome games framework.

The script should run on Linux, Windows, and MacOS using the ActiveTcl
distribution from activestate.com.

Yet to do:

[x] Make undo/redo work correctly.
[x] Make undo/redo work on the game generation thread.
[x] Make count-moves work.
[x] Make a menu accelerator that opens the menu.
[x] Make rows and blocks persistent data.
[x] Make row closures persistent data.
[x] Test generated deal in reverse against play rules.
[x] Loop out the failed deals.
[x] Prune the unused methods.
[x] Implement choose game by name.    
[x] Fix the generator so it doesn't fail.
  This does throw an uncaught exception sometimes, not sure how.
  Found the uncaught exception.  Tried generating with backtrack,
  it's faster to reshuffle on first failure, backtracking never
  succeeded.
[x] Fix the tiles that don't work in my svg-to-canvas
  because they depend on interior regions in paths being
  transparent to the background.
[x] the Red Dragon is filled, path4352
[s] center of South is filled, path4308
[x] 4's are filled, except in Seasons and Flowers
[s] two regions filled in Green Dragon, path4360 and path4362
[x] the 1 of coins is strange
[x] the 2-9 of coins is all over the place, path3518 dots
[x] dots and dots2 are the same except for color
[x] bams and bams2 are the same except for color  
[x] the red character on numbers has four fills that
  are drawn in foreground color in the wrong place.
  now drawn in the right place but still in foreground.
  I think they're inside out polygons.
[x] multipart paths were not retaining the end of the last
  part to the beginning of the next path.
[x] the bams internal whites are not shown
[ ] redo the red dragon, it looks lumpy
[ ] Get the adaptive framing and sizing to work correctly.
[ ] Scale images for window size.
[ ] Make the svg tile set work without inkscape
[ ] Switch back to using xml layout descriptor
[ ] Implement hints
[ ] Implement pause/continue
[ ] Implement preferences
[ ] Implement save/restore
[ ] Implement scores
[ ] Implement Help.
[ ] Implement right/left cursor cycling through hints?
  This doesn't actually work, though I suppose that
  if you select a tile, hint might cycle through the
  matching tiles.  So you could implement a cursor motion
  key mode which cycled through the selectable tiles, used
  <return> to select and then cycled through the selectable 
  matches, and finally used <return> to select the play, or
  used <backspace> to cancel the first selection.
[ ] there is a white streak in the upper swash of the West character
  path4304, resisted initial attempt to fix it
[ ] the coins fade at reduced scale, need width boosting
[ ] Fixe the tilted bams, they are still solid
